## Introduction

This is the inventory management system of the Automation & Robotics Club of BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus. All the code is in Python 3 and PyQt5 with several autogenerated lines of code from QtCreator ```.ui``` files.

This application runs on a Raspberry Pi 3 connected to an 8" 1280x800 touchscreen. Combined with an upcoming Smart Lock project, this will make the management of inventory in small labs much easier.

## Installation
On Ubuntu or derivative distros, simply run:
```
sudo apt install pyqt5-dev pyqt5-dev-tools python-sqlite python3-serial python3-crypto
```

Then, run the file using:
```
./main.py
```
